🧭 About the Project :

WanderHub is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, designed to help users explore, list, and manage travel accommodations with ease.
It brings together a clean UI, secure backend, and seamless user experience — allowing travelers to browse listings, leave reviews, and manage their own properties.

I began this project while following the Apna College Full Stack Web Development course.
After completing the core structure, I enhanced it by adding custom features, responsiveness, and improved UI/UX to make it more user-friendly and closer to a real-world application.

This project helped me understand the entire development lifecycle — from server setup and authentication to deployment and database management. 🚀

✨ Key Features

- ✅ User Authentication & Authorization – Secure login, signup, and logout using Passport.js, ensuring safe user sessions.
- ✅ Listing Management (CRUD) – Users can add, edit, and delete their property listings easily.
- ✅ Access Control – Only property owners can modify or delete their listings, while other users can only view them. 🔒
- ✅ Photo Uploads with Cloudinary – All listing images are uploaded and stored safely using Cloudinary’s cloud storage.
- ✅ Interactive Maps with Mapbox – Each listing is geocoded and displayed on an interactive map for better location visualization.
- ✅ Review & Rating System – Users can write, delete, and view reviews for every property.
- ✅ Functional Search Bar – The search feature dynamically shows listings related to the entered location name only.
- ✅ Category-Based Filtering – Listings can be filtered by property types (e.g., cabins, beach houses, apartments, etc.).
- ✅ Responsive Icons & Filter Bar – Added icons and filters that automatically adjust across different screen sizes.
- ✅ Flash Messages & Validations – Proper feedback for user actions like login, error handling, and CRUD operations.
- ✅ Responsive Design – Fully optimized layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
- ✅ Secure Sessions & Cookies – Session data stored securely with express-session and connect-mongo.
- ✅ Deployed on Render – Hosted on a reliable, free cloud service ensuring smooth accessibility anytime, anywhere.

💭 Reflection

This project helped me understand the complete development cycle of a full-stack web app — from backend logic and database structure to frontend design and deployment.

Though WanderHub started as a learning project, it evolved into a practical and feature-rich web application, strengthening my understanding of backend systems, RESTful APIs, and real-world functionality like search, filters, and responsiveness. 🌱

It also made me realize the importance of designing for every screen size and focusing on user experience first.
